This pearl appears to be a conversation log, or a journal of sorts, between a family of my creators<LINE>This is a lucky find little creature!Many ancients believed that the only way to ascend fully was to leave behind all material posessions and relationships.<LINE>It is a shame that this benefactor's family was likely denied ascension because of that fact...This particular family seemed to care for each other very much...Strange... The last page appears to hold many childish or otherwise random sketches and also lots of references to...What is a "Spicy Mints?"Wait there is more... "It's kind of a funny story?" "Stare Down?" "KAI?"<LINE>Are these... Webcomics??Yeah, no shot this guy made it to ascension. Also what the hell is a "Thiccerator?"
